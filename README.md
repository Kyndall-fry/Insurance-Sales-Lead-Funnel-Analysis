# Insurance-Sales-Lead-Funnel-Analysis
This project simulates a real-world **Business Intelligence (BI) / Data Analyst** workflow: collecting and analyzing sales and lead funnel data for an insurance sales organization.   The goal is to understand agent performance, lead conversion efficiency, revenue trends, and operational improvements.
